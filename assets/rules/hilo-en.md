# Hilo Rules

## Goal of the game

In HILO, the number of points can quickly increase, even if players prefer to keep it low. The game is played over several rounds and ends when a player has reached at least 100 points. During the game, all players try to replace higher-value cards in their grids with lower-value ones, or delete entire rows, because at the end of the game, the player with the fewest points wins!

## Set-up

The oldest player shuffles all the cards and deals 9 cards face-down to each player. Please note: players are not allowed to look at the front of their cards! Players lay their cards face-down in front of them, forming a 3 x 3 grid. This is called their grid. The remaining cards are stacked face-down in the center of the table to form a deck. The first card in the pile is turned face up and placed next to the deck. It forms the basis of the face-up discard pile. Each player now turns over 2 cards of their choice from their grid. The player with the highest sum of the two face-up cards becomes the starting player. If more than one player has the highest sum, the youngest player starts.

## Game sequence

Starting with the starting player, each player takes a turn clockwise to perform an action. The player can choose between the following 2 actions. It is not permitted to skip a turn:
1. either take the first card from the discard pile (face up).
2. take the first card from the deck (face down).

### Discard card (face up)

If the player takes the top card from the discard pile, he must exchange it for a card from his grid. It doesn't matter whether the card is face-up or face-down. He places the card from the discard pile face-up in his grid. The card given in exchange is placed face-up on the discard pile.

### Deck card (face-down)

If the player takes the top card from the deck, he looks at the card and must choose one of the following 2 possibilities:
- either exchange the card for a card (face-up or face-down) from his grid (as described in point 1) by placing the card from his grid on the discard pile, face-up, and placing the drawn card, face-up, in the place of the one removed ;
- or place the selected card directly on the discard pile, face up.

> Important: In this case, he must turn over a card of his choice that was lying face-down in his grid.

## Hilo

Each time a player places or turns over a 3rd card of the same suit in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row, that player has made a HILO and can immediately place these cards on the discard pile. The player thus has 3 fewer cards in his grid.

> Important: The 3 cards must be discarded so that the card with the lowest number is then on top of the discard pile, face up.

When a player removes a diagonal of 3 cards of the same suit, he must then reassemble the two separate parts of his grid by sliding his cards either vertically or horizontally, so as to re-form two columns or two rows of 3 cards each. If the result is again a HILO, these 3 cards are also eliminated.

> Special case: If, after his action, a player has more than one row, column or diagonal of 3 cards of the same suit at the same time, he must decide which of these rows of 3 cards to remove. Only one row, column or diagonal can be removed at a time.

## End of round

When, at the end of a round, a player has turned over all the cards in his grid (or has no cards left in his grid), all the other players play one last time. Then, all players turn over the cards in their grid that were still face-down. If there is a HILO, the cards are discarded as described above.

Each player adds up the numbers of all the cards in their grid.

> Important! If the player who caused the end of the round does not have the lowest sum in that round, he must multiply his points by 2 (unless he has a negative result). Even in the event of a tie, he must double his points.

The players' scores for each round are recorded. If no player exceeds 99 points, a new round begins. Shuffle all the cards and prepare for the next round as described above.

## End of game

The game ends after the round in which a player exceeds 99 points with the sum of his points over all the rounds played. The player with the lowest sum wins. In the event of a tie, there are several winners.
