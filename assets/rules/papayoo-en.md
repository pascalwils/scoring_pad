# Papayoo Rules

## Card ranking

Each Payoo card has its own rank ranging from 1 to 20 (points). One of the four 7’s from one of the four suits (spades, hearts, diamonds or clubs) is the Papayoo which changes with each new round depending on the roll of the dice. The Papayoo card is worth 40 points. The other cards have no rank.

## Object of the game

Collect as few points as possible.

## Dealing the cards

Players take turns at dealing. The dealer deals cards according to the table below. For example, when there are 3 players, the dealer deals three cards six times to each player and then two cards once to each player. When there are 7 or 8 players, players must remove the 1’s from the game before starting.

| Number of players | Cards to remove before playing | Number of cards per player (deal) | Discard (see below) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 3 | none | 20 (6x3 + 1x2) | 5 |
| 4 | none | 15 (5x3) | 5 |
| 5 | none | 12 (4x3) | 4 |
| 6 | none | 10 (3x3 + 1x1) | 3 |
| 7 | 1 of each suit | 8 (2x3 + 1x2) | 3 |
| 8 | 1 of each suit | 7 (2x3 + 1x1) | 3 |

## Discarding

After sorting their cards, players can start discarding. Each player discards the cards of his choice. Each player removes the number of cards as indicated on the table above and places them, face down, in front of the player to his left. Each player must give his discarded pile to the player on the left before looking at the discarded pile of cards coming from the player on the right.

## The Papayoo draw

Once the discarding process is finished, the dealer throws the dice to determine the Papayoo suit. If spades come up, then the 7 of spades is the Papayoo for this round and is worth 40 points.

## Playing a round

The dealer starts the first game by placing the card of his choice, face up, in the middle of the table. The other players then take turns playing clockwise always sticking to the initial suit. Players do not have to play a card of higher rank. The Payoo should be considered as a fifth suit the same as hearts, spades, clubs and diamonds. If a player does not have the suit requested in his hand, he discards a card of his choice. The player who played the highest ranking card in the suit collects the cards and starts the next game. If no players have cards from the requested suit, the player who started collects the cards.

## End of round

At the end of the last game, the players count their points. Each Payoo is worth its own rank. The Papayoo is worth 40 points and the other cards have no value. The score total for a round should equal 250. Players add these points to their previous hands.

## Game over

At the start of the game, players decide the number of hands they wish to play. Four hands last approximately 30 minutes. The player with the least points at the end of the last hand is the winner.

## Remarks

When discarding, players should not forget that discarding a complete suit to have the best discarding possibilities could also mean being left with one “lone” 7 and/or one 9 and/or one 10 from another player’s discarded pile!

To avoid winning a trick, players are often tempted to play lower ranking cards than those played by previous players. Players should know to “build up a few points” in the first rounds when the stakes are low to then get rid of their highest ranking cards and keep the lower ranking cards for the following rounds. This can even be an advantage for the last player as he clearly knows the ranking of the cards.
